# Search Operator
Deploys the Odyssey (OCM Search v2) components. 

## Installing the Search Operator in a Red Hat OpenShift cluster

#### Prerequisites
- You will need [Operator SDK](https://sdk.operatorframework.io/) to install search operator bundle image. [Download and install](<https://sdk.operatorframework.io/docs/installation/>) client version >= v1.15
- You'll need **Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management** v2.5 or later.
- Update the MulticlusterHub CR to disable search v1.
    In the MulticlusterHub CR set `enabled: false` where `spec.overrides.components.name = search`
    ```
    spec:
    overrides:
        components:
        - enabled: false
            name: search
    ```        


After disabling search (v1), install the search operator (v2) in the open-cluster-management namespace.

#### 1. Log into the cluster using CLI
If not done already, use `oc login` to log in to the cluster by replacing `yoururl` and `yourpassword` below
```
oc login https://yoururl.com:6443 -u kubeadmin -p yourpassword
```
#### 2. Create Image pull secret to pull images from quay (Hub cluster)

1. go to https://quay.io/user/<your_id>?tab=settings replacing <your_id>  with your username
1. click on Generate Encrypted Password
1. enter your quay.io password
1. select Kubernetes Secret from left-hand menu
1. Download yaml file and rename secret as  `search-pull-secret`
1. oc apply -f <your_secret.yaml>
1. Verify secrets presence by running ` oc get secret | grep search-pull-secret`

_Note: A secret MUST be created with name as `search-pull-secret`_
#### 3. Run bundle
```
operator-sdk run bundle quay.io/stolostron/search-operator-bundle:latest --pull-secret-name search-pull-secret
```

Wait for `OLM has successfully installed "search-v2-operator.v0.0.1"` message.
You can replace the latest tag with specific image tag from quay to test other images.

#### 4. Apply the empty CR to create the search components
```
oc apply -f config/samples/search_v1alpha1_search.yaml
```
_Note: The custom resource must be named  `search-v2-operator`_
Check if all the search pods are running, use ACM console to search.

## Building search-v2-operator in local machine

This step is only required if you made code changes to search-v2-operator runtime. You DO NOT need to run this steps if you only update the search components tag in search-v2-operator.clusterserviceversion.yaml. You can jump to step (4)

#### 1. Download and install operator-sdk client version >= v1.15

    https://sdk.operatorframework.io/docs/installation/

#### 2. Build the operator and push to quay

    export IMG=quay.io/<your_id>/search-v2-operator:v0.0.1
    make docker-build docker-push

#### 3. Update the operator version in bundle clusterserviceversion to use the image built in step (2)

    Update the file search-v2-operator/bundle/manifests/search-v2-operator.clusterserviceversion.yaml in the container named manager to use the image above.

### **Building search-v2-operator-bundle in your cluster:**

If you want to replace any PR images for any of the search components, you can update in search-v2-operator.clusterserviceversion.yaml file by replacing the tag.

#### 4. Build the bundle image and push to quay

    export BUNDLE_IMG=quay.io/<your_id>/search-v2-operator-bundle:v0.0.1
    make bundle-build bundle-push 

#### 5. Create the Image pull secret to pull image from quay

    go to https://quay.io/user/<your_id>?tab=settings replacing <your_id> with your username
    click on Generate Encrypted Password
    enter your quay.io password
    select Kubernetes Secret from left-hand menu
    Download yaml file and rename secret as  `search-pull-secret`
    oc apply -f <your_secret.yaml>
    Verify secrets presence by running ` oc get secret | grep search-pull-secret`

#### 6. Login to you Openshift cluster, and run the bundle

    operator-sdk run bundle $BUNDLE_IMG --pull-secret-name search-pull-secret

#### 7. Verify the pods

    Review the output bundle installation is completed sucessfully
    oc get pods | grep search-v2-operator

#### 8. Apply the empty CR to create the search components

    oc apply -f config/samples/search_v1alpha1_search.yaml

#### 9. Verify for following search pods are running

    search-api
    search-collector
    search-indexer
    search-postgres
