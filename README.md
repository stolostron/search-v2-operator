# Search Operator

Deploys the Open Cluster Management Search v2 components.

## Installing the Search Operator in a Red Hat OpenShift cluster

### Prerequisites

- You will need [Operator SDK](https://sdk.operatorframework.io/) to install search operator bundle image. [Download and install](<https://sdk.operatorframework.io/docs/installation/>) client version >= v1.15
- You'll need **Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management** v2.5 or later.

- Log into the cluster using CLI
    ```bash
    oc login https://yoururl.com:6443 -u kubeadmin -p yourpassword
    ```

- Create Image pull secret to pull images from quay (Hub cluster)
    1. go to https://quay.io/user/<your_id>?tab=settings replacing <your_id>  with your username
    1. click on Generate Encrypted Password
    1. enter your quay.io password
    1. select Kubernetes Secret from left-hand menu
    1. Download yaml file and rename secret as `search-pull-secret`

### Automatic install
A script is provided which covers step 4 and 5 is provided in this repo for RHACM 2.6 version. You can launch the script and it will offer you the possibility to choose a version or use the default one. You will need to have the secret created in step 2. in the `deploy` folder.

```bash
cd ./scripts
./deploy.sh
```

### Manual install
1. Appply quay.io secret
    1. Ensure to be on your `open-cluster-management` namespace and run `oc apply -f` <your_secret.yaml>
    2. Verify secrets presence by running `oc get secret | grep search-pull-secret`
    > **IMPORTANT**: The secret MUST be created with the name `search-pull-secret`

2. Disable existing search component
    - Update the MulticlusterHub CR to disable the search component.
        ```bash
        oc patch mch multiclusterhub -n open-cluster-management --type=merge -p '{"spec":{"overrides":{"components":[{"name":"search","enabled": false}]}}}'
        ```
    After disabling the ACM search component, install the search operator (v2) in the open-cluster-management namespace.

3. Run bundle
    ```bash
    operator-sdk run bundle quay.io/stolostron/search-operator-bundle@sha256:1a20394565bdc61870db1e4443d4d24d0d8eb2d65f3efdffd068cfd389b370ac --pull-secret-name search-pull-secret
    ```
    Wait for `OLM has successfully installed "search-v2-operator.v0.0.1"` message.

    > **NOTE**: If you receive an error try adding this flag. `--index-image=quay.io/operator-framework/opm:v1.23.0`  
    > **TIP**: You can replace the image tag with other images in our [Quay repo](https://quay.io/repository/stolostron/search-operator-bundle?tab=tags)

4. Apply the empty CR to create the search components
    ```bash
    oc apply -f config/samples/search_v1alpha1_search.yaml -n open-cluster-management
    ```

    > **IMPORTANT**: The custom resource must be named  `search-v2-operator`.

### Verifying search-v2-operator installation

1. On your hub cluster, list the pods. You should see the following pod running.
  ```bash
  $ oc get pods -n open-cluster-management | grep search
  search-api-5884985f56-tx4kl                                       1/1     Running     
  search-collector-85db8d84cc-ndtm5                                 1/1     Running 
  search-indexer-65f975b8b4-bn4lf                                   1/1     Running  
  search-postgres-59b96c5486-xjs8p                                  1/1     Running
  search-v2-operator-controller-manager-549ff4b78b-l9qs2            2/2     Running
  ```

2. On the managed cluster (if you have managed clusters in hub), list the pods. You should see the following pod running.
  ```bash
  $ oc get pods -n open-cluster-management-agent-addon | grep search
  klusterlet-addon-search-7b6645bd4-h7pxj        1/1     Running
  ```

### Uninstallation
You can uninstall the search-v2-operator using the following command.

```bash
operator-sdk cleanup search-v2-operator
```

You can also use the deployer script which will also restore the search v1 and cleanup the secret
```bash
cd ./scripts
./deploy.sh -u
```

## Development

**DO NOT change files /bundle/manifests manually.** This project uses kustomize and kubebuilder to generate the bundle files.

**Running locally:**
- Use `make setup` to configure the local environment.
- Use `make run` to start locally. It will read/write resources on your current target OCP cluster.
    - If you see errors, use `make clean` to reset the bin directory.

**Making changes:**
- Use `make manifests` and `make bundle` to propagate your changes into the bundle directory.
- Validate the generated bundle manifest files with:
  ```bash
  oc apply -f bundle/manifests --dry-run=server 
  ```
- Update the CRDs in your target cluster with `make install`.

**Committing changes:**
- Run `make generate; make manifests; make bundle` before committing changes.


## Building search-v2-operator in local machine

This step is only required if you made code changes to search-v2-operator runtime. You DO NOT need to run this steps if you only update the search components tag in search-v2-operator.clusterserviceversion.yaml. You can jump to step (4)

1. Download and install operator-sdk client version >= v1.15
    ```bash
    https://sdk.operatorframework.io/docs/installation/
    ```

2. Build the operator and push to quay
    ```bash
    export IMG=quay.io/<your_id>/search-v2-operator:v0.0.1
    make docker-build docker-push
    ```

3. Update the operator version in bundle clusterserviceversion to use the image built in step (2)
    ```bash
    Update the file search-v2-operator/bundle/manifests/search-v2-operator.clusterserviceversion.yaml in the container named manager to use the image above.
    ```

    **Building search-v2-operator-bundle in your cluster:**

    If you want to replace any PR images for any of the search components, you can update in search-v2-operator.clusterserviceversion.yaml file by replacing the tag.

4. Build the bundle image and push to quay
    ```bash
    export BUNDLE_IMG=quay.io/<your_id>/search-v2-operator-bundle:v0.0.1
    make bundle-build bundle-push
    ```

5. Create the Image pull secret to pull image from quay
    ```
    go to https://quay.io/user/<your_id>?tab=settings replacing <your_id> with your username
    click on Generate Encrypted Password
    enter your quay.io password
    select Kubernetes Secret from left-hand menu
    Download yaml file and rename secret as  `search-pull-secret`
    oc apply -f <your_secret.yaml>
    ```

    Verify secret is present by running
    ```bash
    oc get secret | grep search-pull-secret
    ```

6. Login to you Openshift cluster, and run the bundle
    ```bash
    operator-sdk run bundle $BUNDLE_IMG --pull-secret-name search-pull-secret
    ```

7. Verify the pods
    Review the output bundle installation is completed sucessfully
    ```bash
    oc get pods | grep search-v2-operator
    ```

8. Apply the empty CR to create the search components
    ```bash
    oc apply -f config/samples/search_v1alpha1_search.yaml
    ```

9. Verify for following search pods are running
    ```bash
    oc get pod -n open-cluster-management |grep search-
    search-api
    search-collector
    search-indexer
    search-postgres
    ```

### How to use a custom/PR operator image in cluster for testing

1. Create a configmap pointing to the custom/PR image
    ```
    oc apply -f - <<EOF
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: ConfigMap
    metadata:
    name: searchoperatorimagecm
    namespace: open-cluster-management      # this is the MCH namespace
    data:
    manifest.json: |-
        [
        {
            "image-remote": "quay.io/stolostron",
            "image-key":    "search_v2_operator",
            "image-name":   "search-v2-operator",
            "image-digest": "sha256:773dad423666ca95f27ffc49f117db2c7fab70252abd21a7f4c844986418fa60"
        }
        ]
    EOF
    ```
2. Annotate MCH to point to this configmap
    ```
    kubectl annotate mch multiclusterhub --overwrite mch-imageOverridesCM=searchoperatorimagecm # Provide the configmap as an override to the MCH
    ```
3. Point back to the original image
    Remove this annotation to revert back to the original manifest
    ```
    kubectl annotate mch multiclusterhub mch-imageOverridesCM- --overwrite # Remove annotation   

    kubectl delete configmap searchoperatorimagecm # Delete configmap
    ```

## Features

### Global Search
**NOTE: The global search feature is tech preview as of ACM 2.11.**

Use global search in environments with the Multicluster Global Hub operator to federate the search
queries to the managed hubs.

To enable global search, add the annotation `global-search-preview=true` to the search operator instance.

```bash
oc annotate search search-v2-operator -n open-cluster-management 'global-search-preview=true'
```
